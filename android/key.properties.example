# Example key.properties for Android signing
# Copy this file to `android/key.properties`, fill the values, and keep it OUT of version control.
# Do NOT commit your real keystore or passwords.

# Password for the keystore (store password)
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD_HERE

# Password for the key (key password) - can be same as storePassword
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE

# Alias you chose when creating the keystore with keytool
keyAlias=absencobra_key

# Path to the keystore file relative to the android/ directory
# If you created the keystore at android/app/keystore.jks, keep this value.
storeFile=app/keystore.jks

# Make sure android/key.properties and android/app/keystore.jks are ignored by git
# by adding them to your .gitignore (an entry for key.properties is already included in the repo).

# --- Usage ---
# 1. Copy this file to android/key.properties and replace placeholders.
# 2. Generate your keystore file (example below). Place it in android/app/keystore.jks or adjust storeFile.
# 3. Add android/key.properties and android/app/keystore.jks to .gitignore.
